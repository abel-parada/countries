            <h2>WHO?</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! I am Abel Parada, chef, marketer, finance clerk, investor, actor and now early stage developer.
            </p>
            <h2>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h2>
            <p>
                This app shows my progress learning react in only 8 months! Search for your favourite country and find out interesting data about it. Ah! And if you want to check the weather today, just click the country card. 
            </p>
            <h2>WHY?</h2>
            <p>
                Because I am obsessed with understanding how to talk to my computer to ask it to do stuff for me ðŸ™ƒ.
            </p>
            <h2>OMG! TELL ME MORE!</h2>
            <p>
